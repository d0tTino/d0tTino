# Running the Tests

The suite relies on `pytest` and `json5`. Some tests also require the optional
[`dspy`](https://pypi.org/project/dspy-ai/) package. Those tests will be skipped
if `dspy` isn't installed.

Install dependencies and run the tests with:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
# optional: install dspy for the full suite
pip install dspy-ai
pytest
```

The CI workflow installs the runtime requirements with
`pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the tests.
Running the same command locally ensures your environment matches the
automated checks.
