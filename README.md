# About Me

Hello! I'm a solo software developer with a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence, aerospace, and intricate game development. I thrive on exploring complex systems, emergent behavior, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code, particularly in resource-constrained environments. My work is driven by a fascination with hard sci-fi, futurism (I'm a fan of Isaac Arthur!), realistic space travel, history, politics, and science. I also have a creative side, enjoying digital art with tools like PaintToolSai.

I value truth and kindness, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting, often using AI assistants to augment my development process. My ultimate goal is to build impactful AI-driven applications and immersive game experiences, potentially growing these projects into a startup.

You can find my work on GitHub under the handle [d0tTino](https://github.com/d0tTino).

## Core Interests & Skills

My interests lie at the intersection of AI, simulation, and interactive experiences.

* **Artificial Intelligence Development:**
    * **Focus Areas:** Multi-agent systems, emergent AI evolution, cognitive architectures, resource-efficient LLMs, Knowledge Graphs, and Event-Driven Architectures (EDA).
    * **Technologies:** Python, LangChain/LangGraph, Ollama, NATS/JetStream, PyTorch, Hugging Face Ecosystem (Transformers, PEFT, TRL, Datasets, Accelerate), bitsandbytes, ChromaDB, and open-source graph databases (e.g., Memgraph, ArangoDB, Neo4j).
    * **Techniques:** QLoRA, quantization, adaptive code generation (exploratory), prompt engineering, and developing sophisticated memory systems for AI agents.

* **Game Development:**
    * **Passion:** Hard science fiction simulation games, focusing on realistic space travel, complex management systems, and narratives that span generations, allowing players to shape humanity's future.
    * **Experience:** While primarily using Python for AI and tooling, I apply game design principles and simulation logic across my projects. My dedication to this genre is evidenced by thousands of hours in titles like Factorio, Kerbal Space Program, Elite Dangerous, Rimworld, and Crusader Kings 3.

* **Software Engineering:**
    * **Primary Language:** Python.
    * **Approach:** Solo development of projects ranging from Discord bots and browser automation platforms to sophisticated AI frameworks.
    * **Practices:** Strong emphasis on modular design, version control (Git/GitHub), testing (pytest, pytest-asyncio), and documentation.

## Current Projects

### ðŸš© Primary Focus: Culture: An AI Genesis Engine
* **Concept:** Culture is a cutting-edge platform designed to simulate the emergence and evolution of AI societies. It's a crucible where AI agents, powered by LLMs, develop distinct personalities, dynamically allocated roles, complex communication patterns, creative capabilities, and intricate social structures.
* **Goals:** To serve as an advanced environment for AI development, observation, and the study of emergent intelligence and behavior.
* **Key Features (Implemented & Planned):**
    * Evolving Personalities & Dynamic Mood States
    * Dynamic Role Allocation (e.g., Innovator, Analyzer, Facilitator) with role adherence mechanisms
    * Emergent Communication & Intent-Based Actions
    * Hierarchical Memory Systems (Short-term, Session Summaries, Chapter Summaries) using ChromaDB
    * Sentiment Analysis influencing interactions
    * Agent Collaboration on Projects & a shared "Knowledge Board"
    * LangGraph-based Agent Architecture
    * Customizable Simulation Engine with scenario support
    * Discord integration for observation/interaction.
* **Tech Stack:** Python 3.8+, LangGraph, Ollama, ChromaDB, and various libraries from the Python AI ecosystem.
* **Status:** Actively under development. This is my main focus.

### ðŸš€ Ongoing R&D: DeepThought-ReThought
* **Concept:** An experimental AI project dedicated to exploring the frontiers of computational efficiency and capability, particularly under extreme resource constraintsâ€”a "zero-budget" AI philosophy.
* **Goals:** To develop highly optimized AI components by leveraging open-source tools, innovative architectural patterns (like EDA with NATS/JetStream), and aggressive optimization techniques. This project serves as a testbed for advanced concepts that can be integrated into other AI endeavors.
* **Current Work:** Fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like QLoRA and post-training quantization. Also planning integration of Knowledge Graph memory.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, NATS/JetStream (nats-py), PyTorch, Hugging Face Ecosystem, bitsandbytes.
* **Status:** Actively under development, currently focused on LLM fine-tuning.

### ðŸŒŒ On the Backburner: Untitled Sci-Fi Simulation Game
* **Concept:** An ambitious hard science fiction simulation game where players take on the role of a spacecraft captain. The gameplay revolves around managing a diverse crew, navigating the challenges of interplanetary travel, and making critical decisions that shape humanity's future across multiple generations in a dynamic space race.
* **Themes:** Realistic space travel mechanics, complex resource and crew management, deep simulation of societal and technological progression, and emergent narratives.
* **Status:** This passion project is currently on the backburner while "Culture: An AI Genesis Engine" is the primary development effort. However, it remains a significant long-term goal.

## Past Explorations (Currently Inactive)

I have a history of developing various AI-driven tools and platforms. While these projects are not currently under active development, they represent valuable experience and stepping stones:

* **SocialInsightAI (PulseCheck):** A social media sentiment analysis platform for Discord, Bluesky, and X, featuring data collection, PostgreSQL storage, Hugging Face-based sentiment analysis, and automated reporting/posting.
* **Prism (DeepThought - Relationship Tracker):** A Discord bot designed to track and visualize interactions and relationships between users using Redis and (optionally) Neo4j, incorporating sentiment analysis. (Shelved due to social considerations).
* **OWL-Agent (Orchestrated Workflow Liaison Agent):** An advanced automation system to bridge GitHub, Discord, Grok AI, and Claude AI for streamlining software development tasks, including browser automation components.
* **DeepThought (Edgy Discord Bot):** An LLM-powered Discord bot with features like tone detection and customizable personality, built with a focus on engaging and unique interactions.
* **Puppetry:** An intelligent browser automation platform using Puppeteer (Node.js backend, React frontend) to orchestrate multiple headless Chromium instances with AI-driven agents, a visual workflow builder, and monitoring.
