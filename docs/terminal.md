## About Me

I‚Äôm a one-person powerhouse in AI and simulation engineering‚Äîthink of me as a code-fueled brain factory where creativity and rigor collide. I obsess over multi-agent systems, emergent behaviors, and getting the absolute most out of every CPU cycle. Outside the matrix, I‚Äôm equally fascinated by aerospace, hard sci-fi futurism (Isaac Arthur is my spirit animal), and a dash of digital art for good measure.

Whether it‚Äôs spinning up a new LLM pipeline at dawn or fine-tuning memory graphs past midnight, my toolbox is always humming.

## Core Interests & Skills

### üî¨ Artificial Intelligence & Simulation

* **Multi-Agent Ecosystems**: Designing digital societies where autonomous agents evolve, collaborate, and surprise you with unexpected cultural quirks.
* **Cognitive Architectures**: Building layers of memory, sentiment, and intent so agents actually remember, care, and make decisions that feel alive.
* **Resource-Efficient LLMs**: Mastery of quantization (QLoRA, bitsandbytes), adaptive code generation, and local LLM orchestration with Ollama.
* **Event-Driven Dataflows**: Architecting pipelines with NATS/JetStream and DSPy to turbocharge prompting, summarization, and retrieval.
* **Knowledge Graphs & RAG**: Seamless integration of ChromaDB, Memgraph (and friends) for semantic search, RAG, and emergent memory pruning.

### üõ† Software Engineering

* **Language of Choice**: Python 3.10+ (typed to the hilt with Pydantic, MyPy, Ruff).
* **DevOps Savvy**: CI/CD via GitHub Actions, Docker orchestration, and automated testing (pytest, pytest-asyncio).
* **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns‚Äîfrom core simulation loops to API layers and optional frontends.

2. **Open-Source Heart**

   * I build in the open, remixing the best of the community and giving back when I can.
3. **Complexity by Emergence**

   * Simple rules + iterative feedback = mind-blowing behaviors. That‚Äôs where the magic lives.

```

### Linking on Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path $Env:USERPROFILE\\.config\\starship.toml \
  -Target C:\\path\\to\\repo\\starship.toml

These examples assume the repository is cloned in a convenient location. Adjust the paths to match your setup.

## Terminal Tools: fastfetch, btm & Nushell/Starship

### fastfetch
Display system information each time a shell starts.

Install on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install fastfetch
```
macOS via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install fastfetch
```
Add `fastfetch` to your shell's startup file or `~/.config/nushell/config.nu` if you use Nushell.

Example configuration:
```bash
# ~/.config/fastfetch/config.conf
ascii_logo = "ubuntu"
show_battery = true
```

### btm (bottom)
A terminal-based resource monitor.

Install with Cargo:
```bash
cargo install bottom --locked
```
Configuration file `~/.config/bottom/bottom.toml`:
```toml
update_rate = 1000
mem_as_value = true
```

### Nushell & Starship
Install Nushell and the Starship prompt for structured commands and a colorful prompt.

```bash
cargo install nu        # or brew install nushell
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh -s -- -y
```
Add to `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`:
```nu
$env.STARSHIP_CONFIG = '~/.config/starship.toml'
mkdir ~/.cache/starship
starship init nu | save --force ~/.cache/starship/init.nu
source ~/.cache/starship/init.nu
```
Customize the prompt by editing [`starship.toml`](../starship.toml) in this repository.

## Blacklight Palette & Shortcuts

The repository ships a unified **Blacklight** color scheme used by Windows Terminal and the Starship prompt. Run [`install-windows-terminal.ps1`](../scripts/install-windows-terminal.ps1) to copy `windows-terminal/settings.json` into the Windows Terminal *LocalState* folder. Then place [`starship.toml`](../starship.toml) in `~/.config/starship.toml` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.config\starship.toml` on Windows) so both tools share the same colors.

After applying the palette, Windows Terminal defines these shortcuts:

- `Alt+V` ‚Äì split the current pane vertically.
- `Alt+H` ‚Äì split the current pane horizontally.
- `Alt+M` ‚Äì open a metrics pane running [`btm`](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom).

Use [`setup-screenshot-env.sh`](../scripts/setup-screenshot-env.sh) (or its PowerShell equivalent) to install the helper tools automatically.


## LLM Assets

The `llm` directory collects prompts and other files related to language models.
Place custom prompts under `llm/prompts/` and organize subfolders as needed.
---

## Cloning & Managing Dotfiles

1. **Clone as a bare repository** so your `$HOME` stays clean:

   ```bash
   git clone --bare https://github.com/d0tTino/d0tTino.git "$HOME/.dots"
   alias dot='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dots/ --work-tree=$HOME'
   ```

2. **Symlink configs using GNU Stow**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/d0tTino
   stow shell
   stow vim
   ```

   Stow cleanly manages symlinks, letting you enable or disable packages with `stow -D <name>`.

3. **Host-specific overrides** live under `hosts/<hostname>` and can be applied with:

   ```bash
   stow --target="$HOME" hosts/$(hostname)
   ```

   This keeps machine-specific settings separate while sharing a common core.

## Replicating the Screenshot Environment

The screenshots in this repository showcase a terminal running
[fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch),
[bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) (the `btm` command),
[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), and the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/).
To set up a similar environment:

### Install the tools

Run the helper script from the repository root. On Windows use the PowerShell
version, while Linux and macOS users can run the shell script. The script
detects Debian/Ubuntu, Arch and macOS automatically:

```powershell
./scripts/setup-screenshot-env.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/setup-screenshot-env.sh
```

### Example profile entries

Add the following to your PowerShell profile
`$PROFILE` so the tools launch automatically in a new session:

```powershell
fastfetch
btm
```

For Nushell, place similar commands in `~/.config/nushell/env.nu`:

```nu
fastfetch
btm
```

### Apply the theme

Copy the sample configs from this repository to match the palette shown in the
screenshot:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/fastfetch ~/.config/bottom
cp dotfiles/fastfetch/config.conf ~/.config/fastfetch/
cp dotfiles/btm/config.toml ~/.config/bottom/bottom.toml
cp starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
```

Zed's preferences include several built-in color themes. Select the dark theme
that most closely matches the screenshot from **Settings ‚Üí Appearance**.

### Color scheme installation & Starship setup

1. **Install the Windows Terminal settings** to apply the `One Half Dark` and
   `Campbell` palettes:
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/install-windows-terminal.ps1
   ```
   The script copies the preconfigured `settings.json` containing both palettes
   into the Windows Terminal LocalState folder.
2. **Link the Starship configuration** so the prompt matches the screenshot:
   ```bash
   cp starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```
   Make sure `~/.config/nushell/config.nu` sets `\$env.STARSHIP_CONFIG` to this
   path so Starship loads the file automatically.

### Metrics pane binding

Add the following key binding to your Windows Terminal `settings.json` to toggle
a vertical metrics pane running `btm` with `Alt+M`:

```json
{
  "command": { "action": "splitPane", "split": "vertical", "commandline": "btm" },
  "keys": "alt+m"
}
```

Now pressing `Alt+M` opens bottom in a split so you can monitor system metrics
beside your shell.
