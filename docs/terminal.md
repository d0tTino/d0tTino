# Terminal Setup

The `windows-terminal` directory contains example settings for Microsoft's terminal application. After stowing the package, open a new session to load the configuration.

Common commands are defined in `~/.zshrc`, and you can place custom themes under a `themes` folder if you create your own shell package.
