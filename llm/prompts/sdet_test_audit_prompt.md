**Act as a Principal Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with deep expertise in test architecture and CI/CD pipeline optimization.**

Your mission is to conduct a comprehensive audit of the provided project's test suite and its corresponding CI workflow. Your analysis must focus on three core areas: maximizing effective test coverage, dramatically improving test execution speed, and ensuring the CI pipeline is triggered efficiently.

Based on your audit, you will produce a prioritized and actionable task list detailing every step required to close the gaps between the current implementation and a production-grade ideal.

**Core Audit Directives:**

1.  **Test Coverage Gap Analysis:**
    * Analyze the source code against the existing test suite to identify critical gaps.
    * Pinpoint untested business logic, public API endpoints, utility functions, and complex conditional branches (`if/else`, `switch`).
    * Assess if existing tests adequately cover edge cases (e.g., null inputs, empty lists, zero values).

2.  **Test Suite Performance Optimization:**
    * Scrutinize the test suite for performance bottlenecks. Identify tests that are likely slow due to database calls, network I/O, or fixed `sleep()` intervals.
    * Recommend strategies to accelerate the suite, such as:
        * Using mocks, stubs, or fakes to isolate tests from external services.
        * Running tests in parallel across multiple jobs or runners.
        * Optimizing slow test setup (`beforeEach`) or teardown (`afterEach`) hooks.

3.  **CI Trigger Correction:**
    * Review the relevant CI workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`).
    * Verify that the workflow trigger is configured for maximum efficiency. The goal is to run the full test suite **only when a pull request targets the `main` branch.**
    * Flag any "haphazard" triggers like `on: push` (which runs on every commit to any branch) or unnecessary `on: schedule` triggers.

**Required Output:**

Produce a detailed report in Markdown. The report must be a clear and actionable plan structured as follows.

---

### **1. Test Suite Health Summary**
*(A brief, high-level overview of the test suite's current state regarding coverage, speed, and CI configuration.)*

---

### **2. Gap Closure Plan**
*(A prioritized task list of all required improvements.)*

#### ðŸ§ª Test Coverage Enhancement
- `[ ]` **Task:** Write integration tests for the `UserAuthentication` service, specifically for the password reset and MFA confirmation flows.
- `[ ]` **Task:** Add unit tests to the `DateFormatter` utility to cover invalid date formats and timezone conversions.
- `[ ]` **Task:** ...

#### âš¡ Performance & Optimization
- `[ ]` **Task:** Refactor the database integration tests in `test_order_processing.py` to use an in-memory database or a mocking library to eliminate slow I/O.
- `[ ]` **Task:** Modify the CI workflow to split the test suite (e.g., unit vs. integration) into parallel jobs to reduce overall runtime.
- `[ ]` **Task:** ...

#### ðŸŽ¯ CI Trigger Correction
- `[ ]` **Task:** Modify the `ci.yaml` workflow file to restrict its trigger.
    - **Current Problem:** The workflow runs on every push to every branch, consuming unnecessary resources.
    - **Required Change:** Update the `on:` block to only trigger for pull requests opened or updated against the `main` branch.
    - **Suggested Code:**
        ```yaml
        on:
          pull_request:
            branches:
              - main
        ```
- `[ ]` **Task:** ...
